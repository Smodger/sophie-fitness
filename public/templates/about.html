  <h4>OUR OWN MENTAL HEALTH STORY</h4>
  <p>I’ve always been passionate about health and fitness, but I focused on the physical; personal training and yoga teaching were driven by aesthetic and physical performance goals and the mind never got a look in. But after dealing with mental health challenges myself, from bad depression in my early twenties navigating anxiety at work and stress in my family life, my attitude and mindset changed when I discovered yoga therapy. Training to be a yoga therapist with world leading practitioners at The Minded Institute revealed a medically informed and logical way to manage and improve both physical and mental wellbeing. This is what I want to bring to the wider world.</p>
